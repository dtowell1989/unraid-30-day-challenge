## ✅ Tasks Completed

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Setting up user shares and adjusting access control
- Where key system settings live (Dashboard, Settings, Shares, etc.)
- How to install community plugins safely

## 💬 Reflections
- 🔹 I liked: the clean web UI, and how easy it was to spin up shares and install plugins  
- 🔹 I struggled with: understanding parity vs traditional RAID at first  
- 🔹 Next time I’d like to: start adding Docker containers and get into self-hosted apps
